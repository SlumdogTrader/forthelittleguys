This is for the little guys (and girls like me) who need help.

I am new to the cryptoc urrency world and wanted to make smart choices on my very limited investment $500. 
I decided on trying out crypto bots (automated trading software) that would trade for me based on my settings (well the ones I pinched from other users and modified!!).
My research led me to Profit Trailer and I found the set-up quite hard even though I thought I was tech savy, obviously not. So this is to help you little people out who are trying to make an automated buck like me.

Check out my settings!
