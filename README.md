This is for the little guys (and girls like me) who need help.

I am new to the cryptoc urrency world and wanted to make smart choices on my very limited investment $500. 
I decided on trying out crypto bots (automated trading software) that would trade for me based on my settings (well the ones I pinched from other users and modified!!).
My research led me to Profit Trailer and I found the set-up quite hard even though I thought I was tech savy, obviously not. So this is to help you little people out who are trying to make an automated buck like me.

Check out my settings and good luck!
