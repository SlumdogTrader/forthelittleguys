# forthelittleguys
This is for the little guys (and girls like me) who need help.

I am new to the cryptocurrency world and wanted to make smart choices on my very limited investment $500. 
I decided on trying out crypto bots (automated trading software) that would trade for me based on my settings (well the ones I pinched from other on E-bay.
My research led me to Profit Trailer and I found the set-up quite hard and I thought I was tech savy, obviously not. So this is to help you little people out who are trying to make a buck like me.
